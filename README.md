# Hand Hygiene Verification Project

## Description
This project is designed to promote proper hand hygiene practices through computer vision technology. Using an advanced algorithm based on Mediapipe, this system can detect and verify the six crucial steps of the hand-rubbing process according to hygiene guidelines. The model’s versatility allows implementation in both clinical and home environments, providing a valuable tool for education and hand hygiene compliance.

More details can be found in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2025.101971

## Installation and Setup

To install and set up the project, ensure you have Python installed and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirementsHandHygiene.txt
```

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:juannquinones/HigieneManos.git
```

## Usage

To use this model, follow these instructions:

Position the camera for a top-down view of the hands (see Figure 1b in the paper[here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2025.101971) )

Run python hand_hygiene.py to start the detection process.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the hand hygiene steps.

This system is ideal for anyone interested in improving or verifying their hand hygiene technique..
